# Data Cleaning, Manipulation, and Analaysis for 2025 Toadlet Ephys Manuscript

## What this project does
This project analyzes experimental data to assess how size, development time, and age influence sensitivity to vibrations and sounds in juvenile toadlets (3 months to 1 year after metamorphosis) using the following approach:
- joining of four databases 
- generalized linear mixed models
- model comparison and selection using AICc
- visualization using ggplot and levelplot

This project includes all the code and datasets associated with an in-prep manuscript.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
